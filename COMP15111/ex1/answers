Q1) After obeying LDR R0 instruction, the value of PC is 00000004 and of R0 is 00000000
Q2) After obeying LDR R1 instruction, the value of PC is 00000008 and of R1 is 00000004
Q3) After obeying LDR R2 instruction, the value of PC is 0000000C and of R2 is 00000003
Q4) The first time the ADD instruction is obeyed, the value of register 0 changes from 00000000 to 00000004
Q5) The first time the SUB instruction is obeyed, the value of register 2 changes from 00000003 to 00000002
Q6) the BNE instruction is obeyed 3 times but only performs the branch 2 times
Q7) register R2 counts down from 00000003 to 00000000
Q8) register R0 is modified to be sum of memory locations R0 and R1
Q9) The memory location for "tom" turns red because the contents of the source code do not match the memory location
Q10)Tom is still red but more registers have been added to the instructions because the program cannot load the data from the memory location
