-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First: checking your Mutt configuration.

Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc exists.
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc does NOT still contain
      `set my_user_name="firstname.secondname@student.manchester.ac.uk"'
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set my_user_name="daronhil.mauricette@student.manchester.ac.uk"
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc does NOT still contain
      `set my_imap_server_name=[SERVERNAME].outlook.com'
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set my_imap_server_name=outlook.office365.com
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc does NOT still contain
      `set realname = "Real Name"'
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set realname = "Daronhil Mauricette"
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set realname = "Daronhil Mauricette"
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set imap_user = $my_user_name
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set from = $my_user_name
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set folder = "imaps://$my_imap_server_name:993"
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.muttrc contains
     set smtp_url = "smtp://$my_user_name@$my_imap_server_name:587"

This seems okay as long as you can send and receive email using mutt
and your name is correct above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second: checking your ARCADE authentication.

Good: file /home/z20375dm/.ARCADE/serverAuthentication exists.

This seems okay as long as you can check your ARCADE details
using the arcade command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third: checking your csstartx in ~/.bash_profile.

Good: file /home/z20375dm/.bash_profile exists.
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.bash_profile contains
     case $(tty) in
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.bash_profile contains
     /dev/tty1) exec /opt/teaching/bin/csstartx
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.bash_profile contains
     esac

This seems okay as long as those lines, in that order, are the last in the file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth: checking your $PATH.

...:/opt/teaching/bin:/opt/common/bin:/opt/scripts:/home/z20375dm/bin

This seems okay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fifth: checking your Thunderbird settings.

Good: file /home/z20375dm/.thunderbird/9qc8x98i.default/prefs.js exists.
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.thunderbird/9qc8x98i.default/prefs.js contains
     user_pref("mail.server.server1.hostname", "outlook.office365.com");
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.thunderbird/9qc8x98i.default/prefs.js contains
     user_pref("mail.server.server1.offline_download", false);
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.thunderbird/9qc8x98i.default/prefs.js contains
     user_pref("mail.identity.id1.fullName", "Daronhil Mauricette");
Good: file /home/z20375dm/.thunderbird/9qc8x98i.default/prefs.js contains
     user_pref("mail.identity.id1.fullName", "Daronhil Mauricette");

This seems okay as long as you can send and receive email using thunderbird,
and your full name is correct.
